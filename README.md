## Project Overview

This project enables users and developers to perform operations on Android TVs using a remote control while simultaneously allowing them to execute all functions that a remote can perform on their laptops or desktop devices.

## Requirements for Project Setup

To successfully run this project, you will need a specific file that contains two directories: pythonProject and RAD (their .exe forms). These directories must be converted into executable (.exe) files using PyCharm. Within this file, you should include the following documents, which are already located in the project's root directory:

cfg
requirements1
png
Simply drag and drop these files into the designated folder.

Spesific File that will be created needs to be looks like this :

## Execution Instructions

After launching the executable file from the pythonProject directory (e.g., main.exe), a window will open, prompting the user to select their operating system—either Ubuntu or Windows—depending on what is being used on the computer.

The program will then load the Remote Control Interface(e.g., remote.exe).

For the project to function correctly, you must enter the IP address of the TV connected to your network into the designated IP address field in the application and click the "Connect" button.

Once connected, the application will be fully operational.

## Additional Setup for Android TVs

To utilize the application, users must enable the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) feature in the Developer Options of their Android TVs. This step is crucial for ensuring the program can communicate effectively with the TV.
